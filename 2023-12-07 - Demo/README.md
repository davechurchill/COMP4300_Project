# Project Demo Features Completed

Copy / paste the checklist from Project Specification into this section to indicate which features are complete in the demo

# Project Demo Instructions

For the project initial demo, you must record a narrated 3-5 minute video showing your project progress so far. The following features must be present in the demo:

- A functioning level editor using ImGui. Does not have to be 100% complete, but you must be able to create / load / save levels.
- Most working gameplay mechanics

This folder contains the following 3 directories:

```
bin/ 
  - must contain your compiled game executable
  - must contain any additional files you need in your bin dir such as assets / fonts
  - do not include any visualstudio output debugging files such as .pdb files

src/ 
  - must contain all of your project source code

visualstudio/
  - must contain your visual studio project files
  - delete all temporary output directories, they contain massive files
    - visualstudio/x64
    - visualstudio/.vs
```

Notes:
- This setup is exactly the same as your course assignments. You may start the project by copying an assignment into this directory and editing it. 
- This entire submission should be no more than a few megabytes at most without the temporary vs files
