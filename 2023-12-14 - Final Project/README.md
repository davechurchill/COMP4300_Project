# Project Completed Features

Copy / paste the checklist from Project Specification into this section to indicate which features you have completed for the project.

Each feature that has been completed MUST be demonstrated in the final project presentation video. If the feature is not in the video, it's possible that I may miss it in my playthrough of the game, and it will be marked as incomplete.

# Project Code Instructions

This folder should contain the following 3 directories:

```
bin/ 
  - must contain your compiled game executable
  - must contain any additional files you need in your bin dir such as assets / fonts
  - do not include any visualstudio output debugging files such as .pdb files

src/ 
  - must contain all of your project source code

visualstudio/
