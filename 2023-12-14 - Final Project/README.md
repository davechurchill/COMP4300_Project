# Project Completed Features

Copy / paste the checklist from Project Specification into this section to indicate which features you have completed for the project.

Each feature that has been completed MUST be demonstrated in the final project presentation video. If the feature is not in the video, it's possible that I may miss it in my playthrough of the game, and it will be marked as incomplete.
